# Crystal Collector

https://md0808.github.io/unit-4-game/

A game of both strategy and luck. A number is randomly generated that the user has to try to match by clicking the magic crystals that contain hidden values. Each crystal is also assigned a random value at the beginning of each game. In order to win, the user has to observe the value that each crystal adds, and continue to add values together until the number to find is met.
